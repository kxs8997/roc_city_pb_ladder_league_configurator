- Verify Tier 1 and Tier 2 use multiple courts
- Check that players rotate within their tier
- Confirm sitting players are selected fairly
- Test that all 4 courts are utilized
- Verify promotion/relegation with larger groups

For 16 players (= 16):
- Verify all 4 courts are used
- Check that no one sits out (perfect fit)
- Confirm each tier has exactly 4 players
- Test standard promotion/relegation
